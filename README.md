# AylBot-League-of-Legends
A bot for league of legends! (Python)

# How does this bot works?

As you can see in code, there are some default (x, y) coordinates that the bot follows in order to find matches in client and play the game.
This (x, y) coordinates are different depending on the screen resolution of the user, so that's why this bot only has "1366 x 768" and "1920 x 1080" support.

Other resolution can be added manually (if anyone want to).
